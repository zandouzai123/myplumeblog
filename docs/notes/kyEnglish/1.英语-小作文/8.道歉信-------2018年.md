Dear Professor Smith,

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		① I am looking forward to my travel to the United States and visiting you in Harvard University.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		② Unfortunately, I have recently been diagnosed with a serious ear infection which will require surgery on the same day as my departure.

③ I am sorry to say that I will therefore not be able to make the travel plan.

④ If possible, I would like to postpone the travel plan to another day later in this year.

⑤ I promise that such a situation does not usually happen and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		⑥ Please excuse me for not being able to inform you of my situation sooner.

⑦ Your prompt attention to my suggestion would be highly appreciated.

::: right
yours sincerely

Li Ming
