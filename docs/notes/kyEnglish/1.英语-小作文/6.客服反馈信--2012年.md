## 正文

Dear Sir or Madam,

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		① I bought an electronic dictionary from your online store on January 1st, but after using it for a short period of time, I found it has some problems.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		② To begin with, the battery needs recharging after a mere 2 hours of use. 

③ This means that I need to carry my charger with me when I go out for a day. 

④ In addition, the buttons on the electronic dictionary are so small that it is nearly impossible to type anything with them. 

④ Personally, I find this to be completely unacceptable.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		⑤ Therefore, I would like to either exchange it for another model that works better or receive a full refund. 

⑥ Your help is greatly appreciated.
