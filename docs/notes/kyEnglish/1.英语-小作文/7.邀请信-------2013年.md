Dear Professor Smith,

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		① On behalf of the "Talents" English Speech Contest committee, I'm writing to invite you to be our new judge.

② As the core of our "Foreign Culture Festival", this school-wide contest is to be held in the Students' Auditorium on May 12 (next Sunday).

③ And we believe that you can give our competitors some enlightening comments as both a native-English speaker and a knowledgeable professor. 

④ Specifically, that event will start at around 7:00 p.m. and last for 2 hours at most. 

⑤ At the end of it, we will have some hand-made presents for each judge and competitor.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		⑥ Once again, we sincerely hope you can be the judge for our competition. 

⑦ Please RSVP before the end of this weekend.

yours sincerely,

Li Ming

Chairman of the "Talents" Speech Contest committee
