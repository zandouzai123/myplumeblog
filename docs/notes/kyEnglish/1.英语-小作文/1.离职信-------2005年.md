Dear Mr. Wang, 

​&emsp;​&emsp; ① I am very grateful to have been employed by you for the past two months as an editor for your magazine Design &  Fashions.  

② I appreciate the opportunity of having worked here with you and my other colleagues. 

③ The experiences I had here are ones I will not  forget for my entire life.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​ ④ However, as a young man whose primary interest is in computer science rather than fashion design, I have found that my present job doesn't fall in with my previous training and strength. 

⑤ I have therefore decided to quit this job to pursue other opportunities that may conform better to my educational background.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​	⑥ Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience my leaving may cause.
