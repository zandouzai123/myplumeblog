Dear Friends,

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		① On behalf of the Students' Union of Beijing Foreign Studies University, I would like to extend our heartfelt  welcome to all the overseas students who will study  in our university.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		② It is my great pleasure to offer you several practical suggestions. 

③ In the first place, life in this prestigious university is perhaps not as easy as you have expected. 

④ You may be tightly bound by daily classes, abundant homework and frequent exams. 

⑤ Thus, be prepared for the hectic life here. 

⑥ In the second place, in spite of all those burdens, various extracurricular activities such as sports meets, speech contests and social gatherings will still provide ample opportunities to make friends. 

⑦ So, enjoy your life in this esteemed institute!

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		⑧ All in all, although there is a lot of pressure, the time you spend on our campus will be worthwhile and enhance your whole life. 

⑨ Hope you like it here!

::: right
yours sincerely,
Li Ming
