Dear Michael,

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		① As one of your closest friends, I‘m writing the letter in order to recommend one of my favorite movies to you—Around the World in Eighty Days.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		② The primary factors for my recommendation are as follows. 

③ For one thing, this is a science fiction movie which tells us an exciting story about an English gentleman, Mr. Phileas Fogg, who makes a bet with his clubmates and managers that he can travel around the world in eighty days. 

④ For another, it gives us a vivid description of the many difficulties and incidents which happen on his journey.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		⑤ Hope you watch and enjoy the movie. 

⑥Looking forward to your reply.

::: right
yours,
Li Ming
