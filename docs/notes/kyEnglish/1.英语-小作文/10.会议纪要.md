Summary of the meeting:

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		①I am attaching the minutes of the last class meeting for your review.

② The summary of the meeting on contributing to Project Hope is as follows.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		③ Firstly, moved by the noble cause of Project Hope and encouraged by what has been achieved so far, we agreed to contribute our part to the project by offering financial aid to a senior high school student in a remote area of Sichuan Province.

④ Secondly, we will seek out a girl whose family cannot afford her education.

⑤ Lastly, our plan is to pay for her tuition on an annual basis until she graduates from high school.

⑥ We would like to remit our donation directly to a bank account opened by her family in her local area.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		⑦ If you discover any errors or omissions in the minutes, please inform me.
