Dear Bob,

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		① I have  just arrived at my home from the airport. 

② As I sit down at my desk, I just want to write a letter to you to thank you for your warm reception in the cultural exchange program.

③ You and your family left a deep impression upon me. 

④ Indeed, the program is one of the most wonderful memories in my life.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		⑤ I remember you mentioned wanting to travel in China. 

⑥ Well, if you come to China, you will be warmly welcomed, and it will be my pleasure to be your guide here. 

⑦ If you would like, send me a list beforehand of the places you would like to visit.

​&emsp;​&emsp;		⑧ Please give my best regards to your family.
