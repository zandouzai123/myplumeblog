​&emsp;​&emsp;​		① This picture reveals a not-uncommon phenomenon of how elders are treated by their grown-up children in some families in China.

② When they are too old to take care of themselves, the elders become burdens to be kicked around by their sons and daughters like a football, a pitiful and unjust sight that has aroused indignation among many Chinese.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		③ As a nation renowned worldwide for its many virtues, China and the Chinese people have been practicing filial piety throughout history.

④ Many often-told stories reiterate this time-honored virtue of loving and respecting the elders, such as the story of Tiying in the Western Han Dynasty who risked her life in order to save her wronged father from corporal punishment.

⑤ Those who try every means to avoid their duties of looking after their elders should bear in mind that they are much indebted to their parents for their rearing.

⑥ Without the loving care and selfless devotion of their parents, how could they have grown up healthily and become successful?

⑦ How is it possible for them to maltreat their parents without the pricks of conscience?

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		⑧ Every one of us should live up to the virtues passed down to us by our ancestors.

⑨ Only in this way can we be worthy of the name of a Chinese.
