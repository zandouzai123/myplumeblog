## 正文

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		① It is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon that a striker is preparing to shoot at the goal defended by a goalkeeper on a football field.

② In the goalkeeper's mind, he is so much smaller than he actually is that guarding the goal becomes an impossible mission.

③ At the same time, the giant guard seems to fill up the whole goal in the attacking player's mind.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		④ The purpose of the drawing is to show us that in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges or predicaments, possessing self-confidence is of the utmost significance.

⑤ Regardless of how much success one has had in school or at work, there are bound to be times when he or she will encounter problems.

⑥ It is at these critical times that one's self-confidence, toward difficulty and toward life in general, plays a crucial role in determining whether he or she can turn failure into victory.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		⑦ I can think of no better illustration than the following one.

⑧ Helen Keller was deaf and blind, certainly nothing to give her self-confidence.

⑨ Nevertheless, she went on to conquer her multiple handicaps to finally become a writer and lecturer, and an inspiration to all.

⑩ This case effectively illustrates that no matter what tasks we are confronted with, we should never overestimate the difficulties or underestimate our abilities.
