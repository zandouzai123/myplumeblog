​&emsp;​&emsp;​		① The pie chart above clearly reveals the factors of consumers' concern on choosing restaurants in a certain city in 2017. 

② Among all the five categories, the percentages of feature, service and environment are the highest, accounting for 36.3%, 26.8% 23.8% respectively. 

③ On the contrary, the statistics of price and other factors take up merely 8.4% and 4.7% respectively, the lowest among the five groups.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		④ Several primary causes that contribute to the above-mentioned phenomenon could be summarized as follows. 

⑤ In the first place, with the prosperity of economy in China and the increase of people's income in recent decades, a large number of people are paying more attention to the features of a restaurant instead of prices. 

⑥ In the second place, in a bid to develop interpersonal relationship and enjoy comfortable life, consumers in mounting numbers prefer service and environment to other factors.

​&emsp;​&emsp;​		⑦ With due consideration of all these contributors, we may predict that with the speedy development of our society, customers in expanding numbers will attach utmost significance to the feature, service as well as environment of a restaurant rather than prices or other factors.
